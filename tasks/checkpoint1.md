Web Scraping project - first checkpoint
1. Choose a website that contains data (a lot) which is not publicly available via an API. The
data should keep being updated frequently, and, every data point (a news article / a
weather prediction / a movie review) should contain as much details as possible). ​Be
creative!
2. Confirm your data source with one of the tech mentors before going to the next step.
3. Read through ​this tutorial​​, or watch ​this video​​ (or both) to learn about the requests
package of Python that allows you to send requests and get responses from web
servers.
4. Read through ​this tutorial​​, or ​watch this​​ video to learn about the beautifulsoup package
of Python that allows you to parse the response.
5. Code your own web scraper. You’re required to adhere to conventions and write clean
and quality well-structured code. The web scraper should be able to query your data
source and print the collected data to the screen. You should be able to change the
settings of the web scraper according to your needs.
6. You can only use requests and bs4 packages, and selenium if needed.

Good luck!
